# Personal-Website
Online Profolio

These files consist of code for my personal online portfolio.

I have been focusing on the UI/UX side of developing something impressive for my users. This has been a step-by-step of truly understanding the best design, color, layout for my website. Each file migrates to one another through its source location. 

It is currently still in the process of development due to online server issues. I need to continue building the server to access the files globally.

The HTML files use built in CSS files to help construct an appealing webpage. 

The png files are being pulled from HTML files locally. The file png names won't be nessary until I get the servers up and running.
